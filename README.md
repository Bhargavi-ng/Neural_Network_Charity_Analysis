# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project is to create a model using deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to predict what organizations would receive funding from Alphabet Soup with a targeted accuracy of at least 75% using the historical dataset [charity_data.csv](Resources/charity_data.csv).

## Deliverables for the Project
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model

## Results:
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.
### Data Prepocessing:
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary:
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
